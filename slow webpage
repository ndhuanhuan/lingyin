Network problems: Is it everyone or just my local area?
Sometimes a website loads slowly not because the server is slow
 but because your network connection to the server is slow or 
 intermittent at one of the network jumps between your location
 and the server. 
 
 
Page-specific problems?
We should also test whether the slowness is limited to specific
web pages.
Many modern web pages contain dozens of complex elements which can make webpage load slow.



Database problems?
If the page incorporate with any database queries, we should probably test for possible database server slowness.


Server load

If the new feature cause a heavy server load, we probably need to test and optimize it.
